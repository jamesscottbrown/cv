I am currently a D.Phil student on the 4-year EPSRC/BBSRC Synthetic Biology Doctoral Training Centre program, supervised by **Prof. Antonis Papachristodoulou** (Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford).

The broad goal of my research is to develop a design framework (including associated algorithms and software) for designing circuits at the population level. Several aspects of my work are focused on solving visualisation and human-computer interaction problems that arise when trying to do this.

## Research Interests

* Applications of control theory to Synthetic Biology
* Relationship between natural and engineered systems
* 'Design principles' of living systems
* Visualization and Human-Computer Interaction

## Talks
* I have been **invited** to give an oral presentation at the IET Engineering of Biology conference in December 2017.

* An abstract about interfaces for expressing laboratory protocols was presented orally at the 9th International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation (IWBDA) in August 2017.

* An abstract about visually presenting and comparing SBML models was presented orally at the 8th International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation (IWBDA) in August 2016. 

## Posters

* *Visual Comparison of SBML Models*, Computational Modeling in Biology (COMBINE), September 2016 

## Professional service
* Maintain [visperception.com](http://visperception.com), a bibliography of experimental studies of the perception of visualizations

## Projects

* 2014: **DTC mini-project 1**, on 'External Control of Gene Expression', supervised by **Prof. Mario di Bernardo** (Department of Engineeirng Mathematics, University of Bristol). This involved designing and simulating controllers that would be implemented in software and control living cells in a microfluidic device. 

* 2014: **DTC mini-project 2**, on 'Applications of cell-cell communication to Synthetic Biology', supervised by **Prof. Antonis Papachristodoulou** (Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford). This involved modelling novel synthetic circuits that exploited quorum sensing systems.

* 2013: Software Developer Intern at **The MathWorks**. Prototyped a web GUI using JavaScript and the Dojo toolkit. Also implemented a new graph layout and improved GUI for a dependency graph viewer.

* 2012: Student placement with **Dr Madan Babu Mohan's** group at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. Constructed a website to visualise and compare networks of non-covalent interactions within proteins. I implemented the front-end in JavaScript with D3.js, and the backend in C++.

* 2011: Student placement with **Dr Bill Schafer's** group at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. Wrote a MATLAB program to play videos of experiments, and interact with metadata and annotations stored in both a MySQL database and binary files. I also had some exposure to *C. elegans* experimental methods, including behavioural assays and calcium imaging.

* 2010: Student placement with **Prof. Jeremy Frey's** group at the University of Southampton. This was mostly spent writing a Ruby on Rails web application to collect experimental data

* 2008: Student placement with **Prof. Jeremy Frey's** group. This included writing Perl scripts as part of a laboratory automation project


## Hobbies

* Sailing
* Reading
* Cooking
* Playing with computers (programming, system administration, etc.)
